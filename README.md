## Overview of the statistical analysis:
W. Avy wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, to determine if the shop  is sustainable year-round.

## Results:

- The max temperature only differs by 2 degrees, meaning there is a reasonably possibility that winter days will be almost as warm as summer days. 

- The mean temperature differs by approxiately 4 degrees. This is incredibly low figure for winter vs. summer. 

- The standard deviation only differs by .5 a degree. This shows that the temerature is remarkably consistent year=round in Oahu. 



## Summary:

- I recommend looking at precipitation data to see if there are major differences in amount of rainfall between June and December.

- I  recommend looking at temperatures closest to where the ice cream shop will be located. While on average Oahu is remarkably consistent between June and December, this could vary depending on station location as most of Hawaii is very mountainous.
