## Overview of the statistical analysis:
W. Avy wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, to determine if the shop  is sustainable year-round.

Results:

There is a bulleted list that addresses the three key differences in weather between June and December. (6 pt)

- The max temperature only differs by 2 degrees, meaning there is a reasonably possibility that winter days will be almost as warm as summer days. 

- The mean temperature differs by approxiately 4 degrees. This is incredibly low figure for winter vs. summer. 

- The standard deviation only differs by .5 a degree. This shows that the temerature is remarkably consistent year=round in Oahu. 



Summary:

There is a high-level summary of the results and there are two additional queries to perform to gather more weather data for June and December. (5 pt)

-I recommend looking at precipitation data to see if there are major differences in amount of rainfall between June and December.

-I would recommend looking at temperatures closest to where the ice cream shop will be located. While on average Oahu is remarkably consistent between June and December, this could vary depending on station location as most of Hawaii is very mountainous.
